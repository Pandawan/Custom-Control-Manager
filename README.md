#Information

Custom Control Manager by PandawanFr. Current Version: 1.0.1

This is an Input/Control manager for Unity 5. It creates JSON files which you can import into other games!
It has an easy to use API and allows to change, add or remove keys in real time so you can make your own control menu in game!

#Installation

To install this, just take the all the files and put them in your Assets folder, or somewhere in there, I will try to make a unitypackage file later for an easier installation.

#API Reference

For API refs, you can go check out the Wiki which will have more information on how everything works.
